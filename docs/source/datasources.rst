Data sources
############
A Data source is a service where published material (metadata and files) are stored, preserved, and made discoverable and accessible; a data source is described by the `EOSC Profile for data sources`_.
.. _EOSC Profile for data sources: https://wiki.eoscfuture.eu/display/PUBLIC/D.+v4.00+EOSC+Data+Source+Profile

Example:
`Episciences`_  is an overlay platform supporting the management of open-access journals on top of the Open Access repository HAL.fr. In this context, episciences.org is a publishing venue (journal, open access, open peer review), while HAL is a data source. Articles published via episciences.org will be therefore linked to the respective journal (publishing venue) and the data source HAL. 
However, HAL is also a publishing venue for researchers that are directly uploading their products; a publishing venue with peer-review and some support for metadata curation. In this case, research products will be linked to HAL as a publishing venue and as a data source.

`A cool website`_ and `The Dino <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`_.

.. note::
    Each research product must be associated with its publishing venue and its data source.
