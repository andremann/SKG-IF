Core model entities
##############

.. note::
   TODO 
      - expand introduction and descriptions
      - double-check consistency of the documentation
      - check provided examples
      - provide an example package serialising an ensamble of connected entities (e.g., for one paper)
      - expand protocols section
      
   
   Open points for discussion
      - scheme/value for external idenfiers: what is the common satrategy we want to pursue? Value is an URL or the identifier value? E.g., "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-7851" VS. "0000-0002-5193-7851".
         Should we provide a fixed set of allowed schemes? For example from `https://sparontologies.github.io/datacite/current/datacite.html#d4e569`_ .
