For the sake of simplycity, JSON has been chosen as a reference data format in the examples describing the properties of the 
entities comprised in SKG-IF.

As a first step, adopters of the SKG-IF can expose their mapped data as a bulk .zip file (all inclusive) 
or as a series of .zip files (one per entity type).
In the future, we will discuss the possibility to create API endpoint for programmatic access to punctual
information and querying.


.. note::
   Consider moving to JSON-LD.
