Welcome to SKG-IF documentation!
===================================

This documentation provides an overview of the work started by the RDA Interest Group on
`Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data <https://rd-alliance.org/groups/open-science-graphs-fair-data-ig>`_ 
towards the definition of the **Scholarly Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framwork** (**SKG-IF**).

Hopefully soon, the work will be handed over to the RDA WG on `Scientific Knowledge Graphs - Interoperability Framework <https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/scientific-knowledge-graphs-interoperability-framework-skg-if-wg>`_ 
which is currently awaiting for the approval by the RDA Technical Advisory Board.
