How to extend SKG-IF
########################

.. warning::
   Work in progress.

Rationale
---------
Introducing extensions to the Scientific Knowledge Graph Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF) serves as a strategic step towards addressing the evolving and diverse needs of scientific communities and projects.
The concept of extensions within the SKG-IF framework is designed to cater to shared interests and requirements that the existing standard entities and properties may not fully meet.

By allowing for the development of extensions that enrich the core entities of the SKG-IF, we can accommodate specialised use cases, specific research needs, and emerging data requirements without compromising the integrity and structure of the standard framework. 
These extensions act as modular plug-ins, providing additional properties and, when necessary, introducing new entities to address ad-hoc necessities identified within projects and communities.

The justification for incorporating extensions lies in ensuring that the SKG-IF remains flexible, adaptable, and responsive to the changing landscape of scientific knowledge representation. 
Extensions offer a way to further develop the framework's capabilities without disrupting existing entities, maintaining compatibility, coherence, and interoperability across diverse datasets and knowledge graphs.

Furthermore, by mandating online documentation and requiring a case statement for each extension, we enhance transparency, visibility, and accountability within the SKG-IF ecosystem. 
This approach not only fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing but also encourages innovation and continuous improvement in how scientific knowledge is modelled, shared, and utilised.

In summary, introducing extensions to the SKG-IF framework is a strategic decision to promote inclusivity, community-driven development, and the seamless integration of specialised knowledge representations within a standardised interoperability framework. 
This approach ensures that the SKG-IF remains relevant, robust, and responsive to the evolving needs of scientific research and data management practices.

Extensions primarily act as plug-ins for extra properties that enhance the core entities defined by the SKG-IF, for extra entities capturing community concepts, and for relationships between properties. 

A community extension of the Scientific Knowledge Graph Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF) is motivated by the need to address specific requirements, interests, or challenges encountered within a particular scientific community. The primary motivations for developing a community extension within the SKG-IF framework include:

Tailored Solutions: Community extensions allow for the customisation and tailoring of the SKG-IF to meet the unique needs and use cases of a specific scientific community.
By incorporating domain-specific entities, properties, or relationships, the extension can enhance the relevance and applicability of the framework within that community.

Improved Interoperability: Community extensions help foster better interoperability among scientific community members by providing a standardised approach to representing and sharing domain-specific knowledge.
This promotes consistency in data modelling and facilitates data exchange and integration within the community.

Efficiency and Productivity: By defining domain-specific entities and properties through a community extension, researchers and practitioners within the community can streamline data management processes, improve data discovery, and enhance the overall productivity of knowledge creation and dissemination activities.

Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration: Community extensions encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration among community members by establishing a common framework for representing and exchanging scientific data and information. This shared understanding facilitates communication and collaboration across diverse research projects and initiatives.

Empowerment, Accountability, and Ownership: Developing a community extension empowers scientific community members to actively contribute to the evolution and enhancement of the SKG-IF framework. It fosters a sense of ownership and investment in the standardisation efforts, encouraging community engagement and participation in shaping the future of scientific knowledge representation.


Applying for an extension
---------------------------
A case statement should be submitted to the WG for each extension, outlining the justification, rationale, and intended use of the extension within the SKG-IF framework.
This requirement promotes thoughtful consideration, accountability, and alignment with the broader goals and principles of the SKG-IF. 
The principles guiding the development and implementation of extensions within the Scientific Knowledge Graph Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF) emphasise the following key factors:
- Shared Interest/Need: Extensions should address a collective interest or requirement identified within projects, communities, or domains rather than catering to individual or isolated needs. This principle ensures that extensions serve a broader purpose and contribute to the overall advancement of scientific knowledge representation.
- Non-Interference: Extensions should not interfere with or disrupt the entities already defined within the SKG-IF. They should not serve as shortcuts for sharing information that should be placed elsewhere within the framework. By adhering to this principle, the integrity and coherence of the SKG-IF are preserved.

By adhering to these guiding principles, the development and adoption of SKG-IF extensions are driven by a commitment to collaboration, standardisation, interoperability, and continuous improvement in representing and sharing scientific knowledge effectively across diverse research domains and communities.
